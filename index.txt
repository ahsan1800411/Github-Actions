What is GitHub Actions:  A workflow automation tool by github

// to rever to a previous commit
git revert <commit-id>

# needs: RunTests   needs commands means when your job depend on some other job to complete first

Skipping the workflow
>>> Workflows that would otherwise be triggered using on: push or on: pull_request won't be triggered if you add any of the following strings to the commit message in a push, or the HEAD commit of a pull request:

[skip ci]
[ci skip]
[no ci]
[skip actions]
[actions skip]

if two jobs install dependencies, then we all know installing dependencies in a node project takes very much amount of time, so github actions provides caches as:

- name: Cache dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: deps-node-modules-${{hashFiles('**/.package-lock.json')}}


// First workflow
name: First Action
on: workflow_dispatch   // workflow_dispatch means we trigger this action by ourself
jobs:
  first-job:
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   steps:
     - name: Greeting
       run: echo "Hello World"
